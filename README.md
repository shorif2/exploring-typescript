# # TypeScript Interfaces vs Types: What‚Äôs the Difference?

TypeScript offers two powerful tools for defining the shape of data: interface and type. At first glance, they may appear to serve the same purpose‚Äîand in many ways, they do. However, there are some key differences between the two. Understanding when and why to use one over the other can make your TypeScript code cleaner, more maintainable, and easier to reason about.

In this post, we‚Äôll explore the similarities, differences, and ideal use cases for both interface and type.

# # # üîπ What They Have in Common

Both interface and type can be used to describe the structure of an object. Here's a simple example using both:

```ts
interface User {
  name: string;
  age: number;
}

type UserType = {
  name: string;
  age: number;
};
```

Both of these define the shape of a User object with a name and age property. So far, so good.

# # # üî∏ Key Differences

1. Extending and Merging
   Interfaces are extendable and can be merged.

You can extend interfaces using extends, and even declare the same interface multiple times‚ÄîTypeScript will automatically merge them.

```ts
interface Animal {
  name: string;
}

interface Animal {
  age: number;
}
```

This is particularly useful in large applications and libraries where augmentation is needed.

Types are not mergeable. You can extend them with intersections, but you can‚Äôt redefine a type once it's declared.

```
type Animal = {
  name: string;
};

// ‚ùå Error: Duplicate identifier
// type Animal = {
//   age: number;
// };

```

2. Union and Intersection Types
   Types are more powerful when it comes to unions and intersections.

```
type Status = "success" | "error" | "loading";

type Combined = { name: string } & { age: number };

```

While interfaces can use extends for composition, only type supports union types directly.

3. Primitives and Tuples
   Only type can represent primitives, tuples, and other complex constructs.

```
type ID = string | number;

type Point = [number, number];
```

Interfaces can‚Äôt be used for these purposes‚Äîthey're strictly for object shapes and classes.

4. Implementation with Classes
   Both interface and type can be used to define contracts for classes, but interface is more natural in this context.

```
interface Person {
  name: string;
  speak(): void;
}

class Student implements Person {
  name: string;
  speak() {
    console.log("Hello");
  }
}
```

Interfaces can‚Äôt be used for these purposes‚Äîthey're strictly for object shapes and classes.

### Conclution:

In many situations, you can use interface or type interchangeably. But knowing their strengths helps you make better design choices. Use interface when working with object shapes, especially in class-based OOP or public APIs. Use type when you need union types, primitives, or complex combinations.
